# A collection of Cloudformation templates 

These AWS Cloudformation templates are things I've been building to better understand AWS and Cloudformation. I'll probably also start converting them to Terraform deployments in another repo once I'm more comfortable with what I'm doing.

## 1. basicWebServer.yaml

A Minimal deployment that creates a web server.... no HTTPS at this stage.


## 2. multiAzRDSSetup.yaml

Creates a muti-AZ postgres RDS deployemnt using a new VPC with 4 subnets. 2 private and 2 public.

This is a work in progress. still some hard coded values that need to be changed.
